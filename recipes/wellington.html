                    <h3>Steps</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Make sure your puff pastry is thawed before you start -cold, but thawed. (Note if it is too warm, it may fall apart, if too cold, it will be too stiff to roll.)</li>
                        <li>Preheat oven to 400F</li>
                        <li>MAKE THE FILLING: Heat oil in an extra-large skillet or dutch oven, over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms, onions, garlic, salt and rosemary and saute, stirring often, until mushrooms release all their liquid. Turn heat down to medium, and continue sauteing until all the liquid has evaporated, be patient, this will take a little time! Once the mushrooms are relatively dry in the pan, splash with the sherry wine and balsamic vinegar and again, saut√© on medium heat until all the liquid has cooked off. This is important- you absolutely do not want a watery filling ( it will turn into a mess!).  Add the toasted chopped pecans, pepper, truffle oil. Taste, adjust salt to your liking. At this point, you could fold in some cheese if you like.</li>
                        <li>Let the filling cool 15-20 minutes (you could make the filling a day ahead and refrigerate).</li>
                        <li>Fill 2 Puff Pastries:  Carefully unroll the puff pastry onto a parchment-lined baking sheet (if it seems stiff, let it thaw a few more minutes until pliable).  Place half the filling in a mound along the center (see photo) and working quickly, roll the pastry up, and over, seam side down. Fill and roll the second sheet.</li>
                        <li>Brush with the egg or eggless wash.</li>
                        <li>Score the pastry using a razor blade or sharp knife with your choice of design ‚Äì cross-hatch, herringbone, leafy vine or just simple diagonal slits.</li>
                        <li>Bake: Place the sheet pan on the middle rack in the oven for 35 minutes, checking at 2o mins, and rotating pan for even browning if necessary. Let the pastry bake until it is a really deep golden color ‚Äì to ensure it‚Äôs done and flaky all the way through. You may need to add 5 more minutes depending on your oven. Convection will help if you have this setting (use it for the last 5-10 minutes) Please, let‚Äôs not have any pale pastries!!! Nice and golden!</li>
                        <li>Cool for  5-10 minutes before cutting and serving. Garnish with Rosemary Sprigs. It‚Äôs OK to serve at room temp, but warm is best.</li>
                        <li>See notes for making ahead!</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4>Notes</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Feel free to add other veggies to the mushrooms, just as long as the filling is not watery and still has flavor (adjust salt and seasonings!). Roasted parsnips, wilted spinach, roasted sweet potatoes or butternut, saut√©ed kale, roasted sunchokes ‚Ä¶.would all work well here.</li>
                        <li>Feel free to sub other nuts for the pecans, like toasted walnuts or hazelnuts.</li>
                        <li>When I made these, I made one roll vegan and one with cheese. Both are good. üòâ</li>
                        <li>If making ahead, I would recommend making the filling ahead, then assemble and bake the day of. OR you can also make and bake the whole thing ahead and reheat ( letting it come to room temp first).  If baking ahead, bake until the puff pastry is cooked through, but not too golden. Let it get golden when reheating. It will look ‚Äúprettier‚Äù baked the day of.</li>
                        <li>You can leave out the wine altogether, and not replace it with anything. I find it does add another level of complexity, but up to you.</li>
